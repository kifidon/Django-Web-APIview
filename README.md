## Overview
This Django-based clocking web application is designed for efficient employee time tracking and reporting. It leverages class-based views for frequent functions and utilizes `asyncio` and Celery for background and scheduled operations to enhance performance. This repo is view only and a `**Redacted**` placeholder has been put in place of sensitive information, thus the code must be modified before it can be run. The actual code repository is private.

### Features:
- **Class-Based Views:** Used for frequent functions to maintain clean and reusable code.
- **AsyncIO Tasks & Celery:** Handles background tasks and scheduled operations.
- **Docker Deployment:** A `docker-compose.yml` sets up Django and Celery containers.
- **Daphne Server:** Used to deploy the Django application for improved performance.
- **Azure Deployment:** A YAML configuration file supports automatic deployment to Azure Container Services.
